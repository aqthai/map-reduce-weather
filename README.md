# map-reduce-weather
Create MapReduce programs to solve the following problems:   1. [MaxTempHumid.java] Identify the maximum temperature and maximum  humidity by Zip code and Year. Only one output record should be reported for  each combination of Zip code and Year.  The output should have the following format:    Zip-code     Year   Max-Temperature      Max-Humidity  ...  00001         1949         120.00                       0.97  00001         1950         119.00                       0.98  ...     2. [AvgRainfallAndTemp.java] Compute the average rainfall and average  temperature by Zip code and Year. Consider only the data of years ≥ 1950. You  program should use the original dataset but only report output for years ≥ 1950.  The output should have the following format:    Zip-code     Year   Avg-Rainfall     Avg-Temperature  ...  00001         1952    1500.00            50.00  00001         1953    1400.00            51.00  ...
